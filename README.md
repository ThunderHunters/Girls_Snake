# Girls_Snake

Girls Snake is a classic snake game built using Python's Turtle and Pygame libraries and styled for girls. In this game, you control a snake to collect star-shaped food items, earning points and growing longer with each successful collection. But be careful! Don't collide with the game boundaries or the snake's own body, or it's game over.
